# Project Proposal

### Group: Luke Rhon, Marc Burstein, and Kenneth Williams

## Introduction:
For the project we will be using a dataset focusing on sleep patterns of 
college students. The dataset has variables that tracked students’ 
academic performance, sleep schedule, cognitive function, and
mental health throughout the study. All the data was gathered from an 
older study in 2012 by Onyper, Thacher, Gilbert, and Gradess. In this 
study, they investigated the relationship between class times,
hours of sleep, circadian preference, and academic performance in 
college students. In their findings they concluded that later class 
start times, although allowed for more sleep, had a negative effect
on student’s academic success and attitude.

## Description of the problem:
Different students in any specific class will gain different grades. 
Most of the grades apply to studying and how well each student can 
comprehend and handle different lessons in the class.
However, there are multiple other different kinds of factors as well 
such as overall mood in or towards the class and what is being dealt 
with outside of class time. We’re studying different student’s
sleeping patterns and measuring if it correlates with how well they do 
in specific classes overtime. We’ll be comparing their sleep patterns, 
schedules, and times with what time of day the class starts
to determine the types of grades a student gets in each specific class.

## Goals/Objectives:
The main goal of this project is to build a predictive model that 
predicts student sleep behavior or performance based on input values. 
Using the findings from the 2012 study we can test those results
by creating a model. Once the model is built and accurate, we can 
incorporate it into an interactive shiny app. Then anyone interested can 
see the results of their input.

## Notes on Research Questions:
1. What effect does sleep have on the performance of students?


2. What is the ideal sleep schedule to boost student class performance 
and mental health?


3. Build a predictive model base on results in 2012 study that receives 
input to predict sleep behavior.

## A preliminary timeline:

Week 2 - 3
Research problem and perform data cleaning

Week 4 - 6
Do EDA to get an understanding of the data

Week 7 - 8
Try to answer research question 1

Week 9 - 10
Try to answer research question 2

Week 11 - 12
Build a model based on original study data.

Week 13
Implement shiny app to interact with model

Week 14 - 16
Write report and improve model

## Technology Tools:
For this project we will be using R and Python.

## Data Sources:
The data is taken from Dr. Reinaldo Sanchez-Arias’ GitHub. The source of 
the data is based on a study from April 2012 by Onyper SV, Thacher PV, 
Gilbert JW, and Gradess SG.
